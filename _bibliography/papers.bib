  abstract    = {Calculus of variations is a mathematical discipline devoted to finding extreme (largest and smallest) values of functionals – variables that depend on the choice of one or more functions. Calculus of variations is a natural development of the chapter of mathematical analysis devoted to the problem of finding the extremums of functions. The emergence and development of the calculus of variations is closely related to the problems of mechanics, physics and other technical sciences. Methods of calculus of variations are widely used in various fields of mathematics. For example, in differential geometry, geodesic lines and minimal surfaces are searched with their help. In physics, the variational method is one of the most powerful tools for obtaining equations of motion, both for discrete and distributed systems, including for physical fields. The methods of calculus of variations are also applicable in statics. There are two main types of methods for solving variational problems. The first type includes methods that reduce the original problem to solving differential equations. The alternative is the so-called direct methods. These methods somehow solve the original problem of finding a function in a given class that would deliver an extreme value to a given functional. One of the most popular methods of this class is the Ritz method.},

 title        = {Structural failure criterion for spatially-reinforced carbon-carbon composite materials},
 abstract     = {This paper defines the structural strength criterion for 4DL-reinforced carbon-carbon materials. For this scheme, fiber reinforcement consists of four groups of reinforcing elements, three of them are located in parallel planes with the angles of 120° between them and the fourth one is normal to them. The paper addresses the first failure of the material corresponding to its yield stress, in this point, one of the material components deviates from linear elastic behavior. A composite material is considered to be non-uniform structurally and consists of a matrix and reinforcing elements, rods. Those rods, in their turn, represent a unidirectional composite. To analyze the stress-strain state of individual components of the material, a three-level elastic model is built that uses the analytic approach at the micro level, while at higher levels it uses the finite element method. For numerical calculations, a structural cell of the material is taken. The boundary conditions provide small to negligible influence of the edge effects, thus simulating the behavior of the infinite volume of the material. For the material components, local strength criteria are introduced, where the fields of the criterion quantities are averaged over the volume of the structural cell. The strength surface of the material that corresponds to its first failure is obtained, and the conclusion is made that the suggested criterion provides a reasonable agreement with the available data on the typical carbon-carbon composite characteristics. Based on the calculated dependencies of the material’s yield stress on the load direction, a procedure is suggested to identify the model parameters based on the material failure behavior analysis using standard tensile and compressive tests. Estimated discrepancies between the results calculated using the suggested criterion and those obtained using the limiting stress criterion for biaxial stress states are given. It is shown that the discrepancy may reach tens of percent and in some cases the material strength increases in comparison with that in the uniaxial stress state. The results are subject to verification tests in order to verify the model for advanced spatially reinforced carbon-carbon composite materials.},

 abstract     = {In order to study the microstructure characteristics of an axially braided Carbon/Carbon (C/C) composite, a comprehensive observation and study of the mesoscopic and microstructure characteristics of an axially braided C/C composite is conducted. Scanning electron microscopy and Micro-CT were used to obtain the microstructure characteristics and distribution rules of the axially braided C/C composite material. The physical model of the material and the geometric model of the representative unit were established. At the same time, the characteristics of this kind of material are also obtained. The microstructure characteristics show that the axially braided C/C composite is a polymer with cracks and pores of different sizes, which is a three-dimensional and four-directions carbon fiber braided body as the reinforcing phase and pitch carbon as the reinforcing matrix. The microcosmic data obtained in this chapter is the basis for carrying out material property prediction and qualitative comparison of macro performance.},

 abstract     = {This text is geared toward assisting engineering and physical science students in cultivating comprehensive skills in linear static and dynamic finite element methodology. Based on courses taught at Stanford University and the California Institute of Technology, it ranges from fundamental concepts to practical computer implementations. Additional sections touch upon the frontiers of research, making the book of potential interest to more experienced analysts and researchers working in the finite element field. In addition to its examination of numerous standard aspects of the finite element method, the volume includes many unique components, including a comprehensive presentation and analysis of algorithms of time-dependent phenomena, plus beam, plate, and shell theories derived directly from three-dimensional elasticity theory. It also contains a systematic treatment of "weak," or variational, formulations for diverse classes of initial/boundary-value problems. Directed toward students without in-depth mathematical training, the text incorporates introductory material on the mathematical theory of finite elements and many important mathematical results, making it an ideal primer for more advanced works on this subject.},
