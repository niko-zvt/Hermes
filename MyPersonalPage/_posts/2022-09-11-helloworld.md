A ["Hello, World!"]() program is generally a computer program that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,[1] and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.

### C Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```  

### C++ Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
  return 0;
}
```  

### QBasic
```vb
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
```
