The Impact/100 is an annual list of the world's most promising impact startups. For Mighty Buildings, it recognizes the 6 years of work that‚Äôs brought us to this point, and to building sustainably at scale. And it also affirms our view that housing and climate change are critically connected, and among the most urgent issues we face today.
